# Ars moriendi

Ars moriendi is a platform game on which you have to die in order to make progress.
It was the first game that I ever submitted to a game jam.

The jam was the Nokia 3310 jam 2, that was based on the theme "Death is Good".
It was a very interesting experience for me, but I had trouble with an overly ambitious project scope.

At the end, I had to settle for much less that I had envisioned, and ended up not being satisfied at all with the final result.
Anyhow I learned a lot from the experience and I was ranked around the middle, which was good enough for me as a first experience.
I certainly enjoyed testing the main mechanic of the game, which is jumping through cliffs in order to kill yourself, there are sorcerers who will prevent you from dying if they see you.
